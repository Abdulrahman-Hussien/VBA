# VBA
My beginner vba code that I learnt briefly :) 
In this repo I'll be adding my VBA code that I learnt and applied on my first days in working in GSK. It's my first time using vba, code might not be the most efficient one but it did its purpose at the time and I'm kind of proud of how fast I learnt it and how it made my job easier so I'm documanting my projects here.
